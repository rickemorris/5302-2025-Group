# React + Vite + Flask
To assist in connectivity install Vite to select the proper installation of React

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**You will need the following**
## Install ReactJS
* React Requirements:
```
ï»¿beautifulsoup4==4.13.4
blinker==1.9.0
certifi==2025.1.31
charset-normalizer==3.4.1
click==8.1.8
colorama==0.4.6
Flask==3.1.0
flask-cors==5.0.1
idna==3.10
itsdangerous==2.2.0
Jinja2==3.1.6
MarkupSafe==3.0.2
requests==2.32.3
soupsieve==2.6
typing_extensions==4.13.2
urllib3==2.4.0
Werkzeug==3.1.3
```
## Install Flask
* Flask Requirements:
```
flask_cors
request
bs4
flask
```
- VisualStudioCode or something to run both React and Flask at the same time

## You can now run the website with the following commands:
### In a separate terminal for React:
```
npm run dev
```
### In a separate terminal for flask:
```
cd /api
venv/Scripts/activate
python test.py
```
#Initial Test
- You can go to in your browser to confirm access:
- http://localhost:5173/


# The following is NOT REQUIRED if you arleady have Flask + ReactJS:
**Setup**
#The following is what we did to setup the website and is NOT required to do:
```
npm install -g create-vite
Project was named : Group Project
Package name: group-project
Framework : React
Variant: Javascript
```

#After install finish the setup with
```
cd "Group Project"
npm install
```

**Setup**

```
npm run dev
```

#Initial Test
```
You can go to in your browser to confirm access:
http://localhost:5173/
```
#Install Flask
- Our main web crawler that absorbs information from Houston SPCA we need python to run on the website. This is not natively possible with React. For this reason we will install flask to run as an API

- To accomplish this:


#Install Flask
```
pip install flask
pip install python-dotenv
```
#Change folders to api
```
mkdir api
cd api/
python3 -m venv venv #To run the flask environment
venv/Scripts/activate
python test.py

- With the above you have both flask and React running ^^ importing this github repo will run the website fully
